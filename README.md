# Price-Optimization-using-Python
Price optimization is a strategic approach that uses data analysis and modelling to determine the optimal pricing of products or services. This process involves considering various factors, including market demand, competition, costs, and customer behaviour, to set prices that maximize profitability and market share.

Price Optimization: Overview
Price optimization is a strategic approach that uses data collection on sales, costs, competition, and market trends to predict demand changes and analyze price elasticity, which enables businesses to set optimal prices. It involves competitive analysis to monitor market positioning, customer segmentation to identify varying willingness to pay, and the use of mathematical optimization algorithms to determine the best price points.

To get started with the task of Price Optimization, we need a dataset based on sales, costs, competition, and market trends. I found an ideal dataset for this task which contains features like:

Fiscal_Week_Id: The fiscal week identifier.
Store_Id: The store identifier.
Item_Id: The item identifier.
Price: The price of the item at our store.
Item_Quantity: The quantity of the item sold.
Sales_Amount_No_Discount: Sales amount without discount.
Sales_Amount: Sales amount after discounts.
Competition_Price: The price of the item at a competing store.
